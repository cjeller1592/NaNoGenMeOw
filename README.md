# NaNoGenMeOw

A play on a prompt displayed on the [NaNoGenMo page](https://https://nanogenmo.github.io/):

> It could be 50,000 repetitions of the word "meow".

```
>>> from meow import main
>>> main()
'Get your novel right meow: https://write.as/zcz8yf2rod65s'
```

This is also a simple way to show how to use the Write.as API (especially for NaNoGenMo). Check out more info about it in the [documentation](https://developers.write.as/docs/api/).

[This is what the Write.as post will look like](https://write.as/zcz8yf2rod65s).
